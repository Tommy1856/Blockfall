# Blockfall

Blockfall is a Person Project developed with Unreal Engine 4.27

The Aim of this proejct was to replicate a mini-game I used to play on _**Club Penguin**_ called "_Thin Ice_". This mini-game had the player attempt to reach the end without stepping on the same tile twice. The tiles were made up of ice that once stepped off, would melt, preventing the player from stepping on there again.

My re-creation takes a sightly different approach. Instead of the player attempting to reach the end without stepping over the same tile twice, they must land on each tile once, breaking them, before they can proceed to the next level. Faliure to do so will result in the player having to re-do the level until all tiles are destroyed and they reach the end.

There are three levels, starting with an easy, introduction, then moving on to the intermediate and final the hardest level that requires quick reaction to break the blocks and move on.
